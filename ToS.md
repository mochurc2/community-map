# Terms of Service
Last updated: Dec 7,2025

HairFetishMap (“the Site”) is an anonymous, user-generated map for adults to share hair‑related interests. By accessing or using the Site, you agree to these Terms of Service.

## 1. Eligibility
- You must be 18 years or older to use the Site or submit Pins.
- By entering, you certify that you meet this requirement.

## 2. Acceptable Use
You may submit Pins containing general descriptions of yourself, hair-related interests, and contact information you choose to share.

You **may not** submit content that:
1. Involves or references minors in any sexual or romantic context.  
2. Contains explicit sexual acts, pornography, graphic descriptions, or otherwise explicit adult material.  
3. Advertises or solicits paid sexual services or any form of sex work.  
4. Provides anyone else’s personal information or location.  
5. Encourages illegal activity, harassment, threats, or discrimination.  
6. Attempts to bypass moderation or interfere with the operation of the Site.

However, users may link to their own external adult-content profiles (e.g., OnlyFans, adult blogs) *provided* that such links do not advertise or solicit paid sexual services, do not reference minors, and comply with all other rules in these Terms.

The Site automatically obscures pin locations for safety, but you remain fully responsible for the information you choose to submit.

## 3. User-Generated Content & Moderation
- All Pins require manual review before appearing publicly.
- Submissions may be silently rejected at the Site’s discretion.
- Rejected Pins are deleted within 30 days.
- Approved Pins remain visible until their auto-expiration date or until removed through a user request.
- You may request removal of your content at any time through the built-in report or feedback tools.

You grant the Site a non-exclusive license to store and display submitted Pins solely for operating the service.

## 4. No Accounts
The Site does not use user accounts. All submissions are anonymous unless you choose to include contact information within your Pin.

## 5. Safety & Interactions
The Site does not vet users, verify identities, or mediate interactions.  
You are solely responsible for your off‑platform communication and safety.

## 6. Prohibited Activities
You agree not to:
- Attempt to access non-public data.  
- Reverse-engineer or disrupt the Site or its infrastructure.  
- Misuse the map for stalking, doxxing, or targeted harassment.

## 7. Service Providers
The Site uses third‑party services such as Cloudflare, Supabase, Protomaps, and others for hosting, storage, and map functionality.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties
The Site is provided **“as is”** without warranties of any kind. Availability, accuracy, and functionality are not guaranteed.

## 9. Limitation of Liability
To the extent allowed by law, the operator is not liable for damages arising from:
- Your use of or reliance on the Site.
- Interactions with other users.
- Your decision to publish location or contact information.

## 10. Changes
These Terms may be updated periodically. Continued use of the Site indicates acceptance of the updated version.

## 11. Contact
For moderation issues, content removal, or privacy requests, use the Site’s built‑in Feedback or Report Pin tools.
