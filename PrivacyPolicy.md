**Last updated: [fill in]**

This Privacy Policy explains what data HairFetishMap (“the Site,” “we,” “us”) collects, how it is used, and your rights.

## 1. Information You Submit
When you add a Pin, you voluntarily provide:

- Gender and interest selections  
- Pre-approved interest tags

- Standard map tile request data handled by MapTiler  
- Server-side logs for debugging and security

Logs are retained for **up to 30 days** unless required to resolve abuse.

The Site does not use invasive tracking or ad-tech. Cloudflare’s built‑in analytics may provide aggregated, non-personal metrics.
